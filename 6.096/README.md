## 6.096: Introduction to C++

[6.096 Introduction to C++](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-096-introduction-to-c-january-iap-2011/) is a fast-paced introductory course to the C++ programming language. It is intended for those with little programming background, though prior programming experience will make it easier, and those with previous experience will still learn C++-specific constructs and concepts.
