2 Catch That Bug

2.1 Missing semicolon in line 20. 

2.2 The setX is a const member function so it cannot modify the object. 

2.3 x and y are private members and cannot be accessed outside the class.

2.4 Scope missing for setX function. Change function name to Point::setX(int newX) 
for it to be called for an object.

2.5 Since 'nums' is an array, need to use delete[] instead of delete in line 10.

2.6 Memory not deallocated. Use delete p to deallocated point from heap memory.
