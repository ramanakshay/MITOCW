Factorials Gone Wrong

1. Program output

number = 0:
The factorial of 0 is 1.

number = 1:
The factorial of 1 is 1.

number = 2:
The factorial of 2 is 2.

number = 9:
The factorial of 9 is 362880.

number = 10:
The factorial of 10 is 3628800.

2. The program outputs that the factorial of -1 is 1 which is incorrect since factorial is defined only for non-negative numbers.
An if condition can be used to check for negative number and then print a message saying that the number is negative or exit the program.

3. The program stops working properly after the number 17. This is due to overflow in the accumulator since numbers after 17 are too big to store in an integer. This can be solved by using long int instead of regular int.

6. Further testing. We have considered all integer inputs. Short datatype is appropriate since computers cannot compute factorials of large numbers.
