What does this program do?

1. The snippet multiplies the integers 'bob' and 'dole' only using doubling, halving, and addition. Express dole as a sum of powers of 2 and multiply with bob.
   Ex. bob * dole
       bob * (1*2^5 + 0*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0)
       bob * 2^5 + bob * 2^3 + bob * 2^1 + bob * 2^0

2. The program assumes that the 'O' is a variable with the value 1. So the main function returns 1 as its outputs. The OS would assume that the program exited with an error.

3. Without the sign. 'acc' stores the sum of 1/i^2 terms. Identify pattern in the sign:

    N   Sign Value
    1   +
    2   --
    3   --+
    4   ++--
    6   ++--+
    7   --++--
    8   --++--+
    9   ++--++--

So the pattern is,

if (N%4 = {0,1})
    acc = 1/1^2 + 1/2^2 - 1/3^2 - 1/4^2 + 1/5^2 + ... +/- 1/N^2
else if (N%4 = {2,3})
    acc = - 1/1^2 - 1/2^2 + 1/3^2 + 1/4^2 - 1/5^2 + ... +/- 1/N^2
