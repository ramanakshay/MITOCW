Scope

1. The program doesn't compile. A compiler error is thrown.
error: conflicting declaration 'char arg1'

2. The program compiles. It outputs the character 'A'. 

3. If the name accessed is within the inner block, the declaration of the inner nested block is used.

4. The declaration of the outer block is used since the inner block declaration is deleted.

5. The program doesn't compile because it cannot find the 'cout' function. It is found in the iostream file.
Moving line 9 to the beginning will get the code to compile.
